Hi Everyone, thanks for being here.  I appreicate this meetup group give me such an opporutnity.

In the next 5 minutes, let's put ruby on the side, and talk about another language, JavaScript.

Does anyone here have experience with JavasSript?

Great!  If you don't know it, that's OK.  This is why I am here.  If you do know it, let's refresh our knowledge together.

--------------------

Something about myself.
My name is Limin Shen.  I work for a company called BazaarVoice.  We are the largest 3rd party provider that powers ratings and reviews.  I write JavaScript on a daily basis.  Here are some other things that I like to do, but no related.

What is JavaScript?
Wikipedia says....
Fancy. In my opinion, JavaScript is a client-side scripting language runs in every browser.

Why shall we learn it?
Because it is very popular language, easy to aceess.  You can see results immediately.  Last but also mostly important, it is very powerful.

As far as I know, JS is the only client-side language that are supported by all the broswers.  

In order to write JavaScript, the only thing you need is a broswer.  

Super Powerful.  I personally categorize them into 3 aspects.
1. Page.
2. User.
3. Server.

Plus, nowadays, with the library such as JQuery, underscore, backbone, JavaScript
